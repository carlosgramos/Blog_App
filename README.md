# Blog App

This is the blog app from the classic "Getting Started With Rails" tutorial. I'm trying to get better at Rails.

It covers the following essential Rails topics:

* Routing and nested resources

* Model generation

* Controller Generation

* Active Record Migration

* Form partials

* etc.
